# Minimal_Blog
This is Full Stack CRUD App using Node.js Express and MongoDB featuring a basic blog.
We can get the views, add a new blog and delete a specific blog.
I'm planning to update it by adding some new functionalities like attach an image with each article, display date of posting, edit blog, and maybe more features to the form like ability to add hyperlinks, spaces between paragraphs and more...
